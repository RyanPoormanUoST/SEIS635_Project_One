## Vision Statement
FlashBack is for any individual or group who wants a simple memory game that can provoke competition via either friends or a personal best. FlashBack provides a progressive challenge by having each round build upon the other, and unlike other memory games that can be over-engineered and more confusing to understand the rule than to actual play, FlashBack provides the basic purpose of a memory challenge without any confusion.

## Rules
1, Played in a series of rounds
2, The game starts by selecting the game settings. These settings include:
- specifying the number of users
- picking the cards rulesets
- setting the speed of each round 
3. Once the game has started, each round randomly displays a new card for a set period of time. Once that card disappears, each player must enter the card shown in the order of its corresponding round.

For Example: Round #1 shows a 5 of spades. Each user would enter the corresponding card. Round #2 shows a King of hearts, each player would then have to enter a 5 of spades and then a King of hearts.

4. If a player enters a wrong card or a card out of sequence, they are out of the game.
5. This pattern repeats until there is only one player remaining.
